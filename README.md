# **Executive Summary**
This report examines the phenomenon of financial overconfidence—households that rate their financial knowledge highly but exhibit low financial health. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), we identify that approximately 9.1 million U.S. households fall into this overconfident segment, with an additional 27.3 million at risk of becoming financially unhealthy.

Our analysis reveals that overconfident households face persistent challenges in long-term wealth building, debt management, and saving discipline. Despite perceiving themselves as financially knowledgeable, their behaviors indicate structural weaknesses in planning and execution. Importantly, we find that households with an established financial plan, regardless of their literacy level, consistently demonstrate stronger financial health.

These insights suggest that policy interventions and financial institutions can leverage perceived literacy as an entry point for engagement. By offering tailored, “advanced-feeling” planning tools and strategies, stakeholders can help overconfident households translate their confidence into sustainable financial stability, improving both individual resilience and overall economic wellbeing.

# **Findings & Conclusions**
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF 2022), this study reveals the typical characteristics and potential risks of the “financially overconfident” population.

Using our constructed financial health index, we find that while financial literacy and financial health are positively correlated, their relationship is not linearly synchronized. Across the national sample, approximately 9.1 million U.S. households fall into the “high self-assessment, low financial health” category—commonly referred to as the overconfident group. This finding draws our particular attention.

We further analyze their user profiling: predominantly middle-aged men (60.8% male, 39.2% female), with above-average education levels (32% high school, 30.9% some college, 28% college graduates). They are primarily non-Hispanic White, have fewer children, and show a high level of employment participation. Although they believe they possess strong financial knowledge, their actual financial outcomes fall short of expectations.

They exhibit three major pain points:

1. Insufficient savings — saving propensity is about 20% lower than that of average households.

2. Lack of investment — lower stock ownership limits their ability to accumulate wealth.

3. High indebtedness — debt levels are about 42% higher than other groups, with greater reliance on non-bank lending channels.

Further analysis shows that their savings are mainly for liquidity or household expenses, while retirement and long-term investment are often neglected. Their loans frequently come from non-bank institutions, reflecting both knowledge gaps and potential credit risks. Many rely on revolving credit card debt or loans from real estate or small lending companies. While these channels meet short-term liquidity needs, they often bring higher interest rates and default risks, leading to “liquidity anxiety” and a “confidence–behavior gap.”

In financial markets, they relatively tend to be risk-averse, yet lack systematic financial planning awareness. Although they consider themselves “financially knowledgeable,” only 23% have a formal financial plan—significantly lower than the 60% observed in the “high-literacy and high-health” group. This suggests that knowing does not necessarily mean doing.

Therefore, creating a financial plan serves as the key bridge to close the “confidence–behavior” gap. Improving financial health depends not only on knowledge but also on execution and long-term planning ability.

From a business perspective, this study offers several insights:

**Targeted Positioning:** Financial institutions can identify the “high-literacy but low-health” segment and provide personalized planning services and automated budgeting tools.

**Behavioral Guidance:** Mechanisms such as cooling-off prompts or spending report feedback can help users self-correct overconfidence.

**Educational Deepening:** Financial education programs should emphasize depth and practical application, avoiding the “shallow knowledge trap” that fosters false confidence.eg:Partner with FinTech platforms to pilot AI-driven financial literacy coaching and measure its effectiveness in improving real behaviors.

**Collaborative Expansion:** Companies and employers can embed financial planning tools into employee benefit programs, encouraging middle-income groups to adopt sustainable and healthy financial habits.

Overall, financial overconfidence is not purely a risk—it also represents a potential opportunity for education and product innovation. If confidence can be transformed into action through structured planning and behavioral intervention, it can significantly enhance household financial stability and strengthen overall economic resilience.
